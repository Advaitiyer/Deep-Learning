# Deep-Learning

The repository consists of two projects:

1. Logistic Regression Neural Network: This is a simple neural network with Logistic function as the activations.

2. Planar classification with Hidden Layer: This is a deep neural network used for classification of objects. Here, ReLU is used in the first and hidden layers, and Logistic function is used for the last layer.
